### Question:
- I found it a bit odd to calculate the effective field goal % for each zone.  Effective field goal % is a stat that combines 2 and 3 point shooting to give an overall picture.  I understand that we need some way to quantify the fact 3 pointers have a larger impact than 2 pointers on the game; but would an effective field goal percentage of above 100% be valid as this is technically possible for a 3 point zone.  If someone shoots 100% from a 3 point zone, all there shots in that zone are counted twice, the second time with the weight factor.
